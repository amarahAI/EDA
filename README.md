# EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis


 I'm a Data Junkie who likes to Data Clean and Data visualization to generate insights, wrangle through huge data sets of usage, 
 stats to find the causes of what is driving the business in different markets. 
 
 For EDA purpose i generally prefer automated techniques and PowerBI for a quick insights to answer business questions.
