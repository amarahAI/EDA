# EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis


 I'm a Data Junkie who likes to Data Clean and Data visualization to generate insights, wrangle through huge data sets of usage, 
 stats to find the causes of what is driving the business in different markets. 
 
 I have used automated techniques in Python and PowerBI for a quick insights to answer business questions.
 
 
 I secretly love the data wrangling step of of the analytics process considering the below ~
✔️Cleaning the raw data.
✔️Recoding variables.
✔️Combining data with other sources/datasets.
✔️Engineering new variables.
✔️Validating data to ensure data quality.
